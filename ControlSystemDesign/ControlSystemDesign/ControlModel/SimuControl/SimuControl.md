# What's This?
This is a Small, Soft, and .net core Mathematical package for design ControlSystem using C#.
We call it SimuControl Which is look like Simulink in Matlab. However,it is not such great to use like Matlab
but we will add it in following years.
# why is nothing here?
We just begin write the basic control algothrim so the simulation function cannot be soon OK.

Please Wait Us or Do it With Us.

You might need to learn the WPF (WinForm will also be OK) and the basic function like draging and so on.
