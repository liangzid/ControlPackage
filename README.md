# ControlPackage
This is the C# implement of the Control Model, Algorithms, and Simulation package.

## How To Use It?

## Has it been Completed ?
No! We have More Works to do. For example, we need to accomplish the work of the StatementModel, and then working on SimulationControl, and so on...

However,it may not be continued until 2019, Sept.
